# HTML - Work in Progress

#### Common Markup Patterns

Common markup patterns useful for developing prototypes or creating new themes. 

# Features

* Modular file structure - add your own patterns, or delete the ones you don't like.
* Semantic markup examples for common design patterns.
* Thoroughly commented code (Useful comments and reference links for new HTML developers)

# Getting started

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run 
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/html.git [yourNewRepoName]
    cd [yourNewRepoName]
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:[yourUserName]/[yourNewRepoName].git
    git remote -v
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:[yourUserName]/[yourNewRepoName].git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:[yourUserName]/[yourNewRepoName].git (push)
```
  
* Once you add & commit files you are ready to publish run:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Now your set up to use this in a new project.
